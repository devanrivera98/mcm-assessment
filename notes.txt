1. Attempted to use MutationObservation but felt more constraining looking for changes to the root of the project causing performance issues
2. Where no actual class names were found I would attempt to loop through all elements until it matched the text. Othertimes I would extract the exact element needed.
3. Made a conscious decision to make conditional checks such as isMobile and isUserIdEven happen inside each function needed instead of checking once all functions are ready
4. Utilized defer on my javascript script file and used setTimeout because I wanted to confirm that the react script was ran first
5. I made the decision to not make reusable functions for things like table one or table two since the requirements require one javascript file it helps for my personal readability to have different names.
